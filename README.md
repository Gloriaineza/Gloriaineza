👋 Hi, I’m @Gloriaineza

👀 I’m interested in technology, web development (PHP, Laravel, JSP), digital literacy, artificial intelligence, and learning new tech skills.

🌱 I’m currently learning Python, React.js, AI basics, and strengthening my web development and project management skills.

💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on projects that help me grow my skills and gain more experience in tech.
